            ## Issue Reference
      
            In order to be considered for merging, the pull request description must refer to a 
            specific issue number. This is described in our 
            [Contributing Guide](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/getting-started/). 

            This check is looking for a phrase similar to: "Fixes #XYZ" or "Resolves #XYZ" where XYZ is the issue
            number that this PR is meant to address.

            ## Protected Branch
      
            In order to be considered for merging, the pull request changes must 
            not be implemented on the "%branch%" branch. This is described in our 
            [Contributing Guide](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/getting-started/). 
            We would suggest that you close this PR and implement your changes as 
            described in our Contributing Guide and open a new pull request.
